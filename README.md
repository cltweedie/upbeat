# We Got Coders Final Project

## Upbeat

[View the project](https://upbeat-wgc.herokuapp.com)

I made this app over a *two-week iteration*; at the end of a three-month, intensive web development course at [We Got Coders](http://wegotcoders.com).

The app is designed for musicians and music producers to share samples they have made (drum loops, hits, riffs etc). The audio samples (in WAV format) are uploaded and stored on amazon S3, as is a waveform representation of the sound that is rendered after the sound has been uploaded.

Key Gems: Devise / OmniAuth / Carrierwave / Waveform / SoundManager2 / Bootstrap-sass

APIs: Soundcloud / AmazonS3 / Stripe

### Test Statistics

Uses *Rspec* for unit testing and *Cucumber* for integration testing.

* Code-to-test ratio of 1:1.6
* Test coverage of 96.62%
